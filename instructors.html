									<h2>Peder Zwilgmeyer<br /></h2>
									<p>Peder's fascination with swords began at an early age, often playing with sticks in the schoolyard. He started with HEMA in the autumn of 2016 with no prior experience as he began his studies. He's also been training reenactment fighting with Bispeliden for some semesters in parallell.
										In 2019 Peder entered the board of the club as an accountant, before being elected leader in 2020. He is also one of several instructors in the club, instructing both old and new members. Primarily longsword techniques is teached, and occationally other weaponry such as sabre, sword and buckler or daggers.
										Peder is currently working on a masters in Cybernetics and Robotics fulltime, which will be finished during the spring of 2021.</ul>

									<h2>Ivan Volokhan<br /></h2>
									I grew up with books and movies about knights and the middle ages, both from historical and fantasy worlds. I wanted to find something that resembles them, however, most types of fencing just did not fit my criteria of fun, realistic, and tough. Finally, I found HEMA in the year 2017. For me, this sport fits every one of my criteria mentioned above. I grew especially fond of sabre-fencing, seeing as it felt more energetic and the strikes felt more high risk – high reward. Right now, I am working on becoming close to ambidextrous in fencing, even though that is a struggle for me.
									I actively partook in the role of instructor and assisting instructor in 2020 and was (later in the year) elected to be a board member and media responsible. My previous experience is 10 years of training Taekwondo, around three of which I have been an instructor. I am on my second year of master studies of pedagogics at NTNU as of now.</p>

									<h2>Didrik Rossbach<br /></h2>

When Trondheim HEMA was founded in 2014 Didrik was one of the first members to join and for the past years been a board member and one of the main instructors.

As an instructor Didrik loves to instruct and introduce members in as many different weapons as he can, not only informing the students in technique, but thorough understanding of the martial principle and cultural contexts.
